          Cheaper than most Pokemon catching plans at other gyms and a lot cheaper than personal trainers. The Silver package is for people who want a professional, personalized training program written for them, that they can have confidence in. Without needing to commit to lots of extra communication. Maybe you are too busy and need the plan but not the other extras that are often included in more expensive training packages.
